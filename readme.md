# Stock Prediction: LSTM & SA
Predicting **Kanoria Chemicals** stock price using Long Short-Term Memory and Sentiment Analysis.

**Progress:**
- [x] Study LSTM, SA and learn their application.
- [x] Prepare data.
- [x] Build model and make predictions
- [ ] Documentation.

## Data Preparation
There were 3 million+ datapoints for the news data, and just about 3500+ for the stock data. 

Here is what I did in this step:
* Dropped news data that was from before the company's origin. 
* Removed the data that was from days when the market was closed or the stocks weren't traded. 
* There were multiple news headlines from different papers for each day, including ones useless for this purpose (entertainment, horoscopes, sports, etc.). I kept only the useful headlines and dropped the rest.
* I randomly selected one headline for each day (since there were still multiple), and finally merged the news and stock data into one dataset.

Final dataset sample:

## Model Building

I have found a notebook explaining the usage of LSTM for stocks data and have modified the code in it to fit my use case. The original code can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/amarsharma768/stock-price-prediction-using-lstm/notebook).

Here are the changes I made:
- Changed the code to fit 4 features instead of two.
- Fixed the inverse transform parts.
- Reduced the number of epochs.
- Converted it into a function and made it reproducible.

### LSTM Prediction

- **Train RMSE**: 9.31
- **Test RMSE:** 4.76

- Before the break around 2019 is the train set, and after that is the test set.

**Next 10 days prediction:**

Since the data was limited to 30 March 2022 only because of the news headlines data; I had access to the actual stock price data for the days after that, and so I decided to compare my results with the actual price.

**Next 10 days - Predicted vs Actual:**

- From these results, it can be concluded that you should not use my model for actual investment.

### Random Forest Prediction

Since my model also has to use the sentiment scoring that I performed for predictions, I have also made a Random Forest Regressor model. I have only evaluated it on one train and test set though, and have not tuned it. So the performance may be a rough estimate.

I have used the features `open`, `close`, `low`, `adj close`, 'volume' of the stock data, and 'neg', 'neu', 'pos' from the sentiment scoring as the independent variables and `high` as the target variable.

RMSE: 0.97
