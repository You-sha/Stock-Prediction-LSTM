## Data Preparation
There were 3 million+ datapoints for the news data, and just about 3500+ for the stock data. 

Here is what I did in this step:
* Dropped news data that was from before the company's origin. 
* Removed the data that was from days when the market was closed or the stocks weren't traded. 
* There were multiple news headlines from different papers for each day, including ones useless for this purpose (entertainment, horoscopes, sports, etc.). I kept only the useful headlines and dropped the rest.
* I randomly selected one headline for each day (since there were still multiple), and finally merged the news and stock data into one dataset.

Final dataset sample:
